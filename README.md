# ICON Tracker

ICON-Tracker is a simple interface for browsing blocks, transactions and addresses on ICON.

It is basically a clone from the existing official [ICON tracker](https://tracker.icon.foundation), but as its source hasn't been released yet, I made my own.

I use this project as a study project on ICON development. Please don't expect too much from it.
